Leaf MVC is a lightweight but feature-rich MVC framework built on top of [leaf php](https://leafphp.dev). It gives you the structure and tools of larger frameworks like Laravel and Ruby on Rails with the simplicity and elegance of Leaf.

## Setting up

You can install Leaf MVC with the [Leaf CLI](https://cli.leafphp.dev)

```sh
leaf create <project-name> --mvc
```

This will scaffold a basic MVC application and set up your environment for you. You can add features like authentication, database migrations, and more with the Leaf CLI. Find the full documentation on the [Leaf website](https://leafphp.dev/docs/mvc/).

To run your Leaf MVC application, use

```bash
php leaf serve
```

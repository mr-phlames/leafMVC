[![Total Downloads](https://poser.pugx.org/leafs/mvc/downloads)](https://packagist.org/packages/leafs/mvc)

Leaf MVC is a lightweight but feature-rich MVC framework built on top of [leaf php](https://leafphp.dev). It gives you the simplicity of Leaf and it's modules with the structure of an MVC framework. Leaf MVC is a great choice for building applications that scale without the complexity of most modern frameworks.

## 📦 Installation

You can install Leaf MVC with the [Leaf CLI](https://cli.leafphp.dev)

```sh
leaf create <project-name> --mvc
```

Or for a more personalized installation, you can add `--custom` to the command

```sh
leaf create <project-name> --mvc --custom
```

You can also use [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/) if you don't want to use the Leaf CLI, although we recommend using the CLI for a better experience:

```bash
composer create-project leafs/mvc <project-name>
```

Note that `<project-name>` is the name of the project you want to create, and that will be your folder name. You can also use `.` to install in the current directory.

## 🗂 Directory Structure

```bash
C:.
├───app
│   ├───controllers
│   ├───database
│   ├───models
│   ├───routes
│   └───views
│       ├───css
│       └───errors
├───public
│   └───assets
│       ├───css
│       └───img
└───vendor
```

This directory structure is our opinionated way of organizing your MVC application. It is a blend of the best practices from different frameworks like Ruby on Rails and Laravel and some of our own experience building applications.

To run your Leaf MVC application, use

```bash
php leaf serve
```

## 🤩 Sponsoring Leaf

We are committed to keeping Leaf open-source and free, but maintaining and developing new features now requires significant time and resources. As the project has grown, so have the costs, which have been mostly covered by the team. To sustain and grow Leaf, we need your help to support full-time maintainers.
